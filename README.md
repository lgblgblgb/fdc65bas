## What?

My first tries in BASIC65 (on MEGA65) to read floppy disk, using POKEs and
PEEKs (direct I/O).

## But why?!

* Why not.
* Why BASIC? Because I am bad at it. It can be fun ;)

## Stuff

### fdc.bas

The BASIC65 program itself. In TEXT format.

### fdc.prg

The BASIC65 program in tokenized form.

### fdc.d81

Do not use this! This is not fdc.prg in a D81 image, but a test D81 image!
