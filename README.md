## What?

My first tries in BASIC65 (on MEGA65) to read floppy disk, using POKEs and
PEEKs (direct I/O).

## But why?!

* Why not.
* Why BASIC? Because I am bad at it. It can be fun ;)

## Stuff

Directories:

### read-demo/

A simple sector read demonstartion with hex dump and such.
Note: the file fdc.d81 is **not** something you can use too much,
it's a test file. Use fdc.prg if you want the actual tokenized program.

### imager/

An attempt to write a simple MS-DOS floppy imager.
